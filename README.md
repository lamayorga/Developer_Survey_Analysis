## Summary of Findings
A summary of findings and visuals can be found on [this blog post](https://medium.com/@lamayorga/looking-for-a-developer-job-some-things-you-should-consider-82133fc5bb5c).


The 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey revealed the following insights for full-time Employed developers:

* The 10 most common programming languages in decreasing popularity are: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Python, Java, Bash/Shell/PowerShell, C#, TypeScript, PHP, and C++. The least common languages in increasing order include: Julia, Haskell, Dart, Perl, Scala, Objective C, Assembly, Rust, R, and Swift.
* When asked about the importance of education in their roles, developers provided rankings. The most common response was 'Fairly important' and least frequent response was 'Critically important'.
* The top three reported reasons that developers search for another job is to find 'better compensation', 'wanting to work with new technologies', and 'curious about other opportunities'. The least common reasons developers job hunt were reported as 'having a bad day (or week or month) at work', 'trouble with my direct manager', and 'just because'.
* When job searching, developers turn to 'Company reviews from third party sites' when researching companies. This is followed by reading company media and discussing companies with personal networks.
* Developers in the US have the greatest annual salary averaging at 209,213 USD followed by the UK (138,750 USD) and Canada (115,190 USD). There is a positive skew in distribution for all countries listed. It is important to note that 46% of surveyors did not include their salary. While these numbers serve as a good prediction, they do not indicate causation. Additional data from respondents is required for more accurate analyses.
